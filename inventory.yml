#### YAML inventory file

# the two first lines above are needed for the script
# to identify the file as an inventory file
#
# See: https://github.com/leboncoin/simple-ansible-inventory
#
# The 'build-inventory.py' scirpt is used to convert this yaml file
# into an ansible compatible file. This file is much simpler to use.
#
# EXAMPLE COMMANDS:
#   Raw (json) output from script:
#       ./build-inventory.py --list
#
#   YAML output as ansible sees it:
#       ansible-inventory -i build-inventory.py --list -y
#
#   Running a playbook with the script:
#       ansible-playbook -i build-inventory.py --limit v1 common.yml
#
## Structure
